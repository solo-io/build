changelog:
- type: NEW_FEATURE
  description: |
    Added two fields to the build spec:
    * `release_helm_repository`: target helm repo for release builds
    * `test_helm_repository`: target helm repo for other builds

    The new `parse-env helm-repo` sub-command will return the appropriate value depending on the build context.
